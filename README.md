# Scoreboard
A simple app for keeping track of dart scores. Built with HTML, JavaScript & jQuery.

## Rules
* After each player takes her/his turn, their name and score is entered into the text input in the format `name, score`.
* Clicking `Add to Rankings` parses the contents of the form field and adds the output to the rankings.
* The rankings should be appended to `ul#rankings` and formatted.
* Players with the same score are 'tied', and should have the same rank.
* Players can take any number of turns. The results of multiple turns are added to the players' score.
